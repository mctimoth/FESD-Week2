FESD Week2

# Topic 2 notes
* Operators: logical, comparison
    * Video: `==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`    with `&&` and `||` defined as "special" in that we can use them to join boolean into more complex boolean expressions 
    * MDN Overview: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators
    * Notions of equality (`==` versus `===`)
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality
    * Advanced discussion
        * Equality comparisons
            * Strict Equality Comparison http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.6
            * Abstract Equality Comparison http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3 (see overview in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality#Description)
        * Relational comparisons
            * Abstract Relational Comparison https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-abstract-relational-comparison (see overview in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Less_than#Description)
* Conditionals
    * Video: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`;  nesting, "flattening"
        * Note importance of `break` statement, `default` "fall-through" behavior
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch
* Loops and iteration
    * Video: `for` `while`, `do while`; `for...in`, `for ... of`
        * Incidental: `%` (modulo) operator, `i` as common convention for indices (also `j`, `k`...)
        * Discussion on `do while` https://stackoverflow.com/questions/994905/is-there-ever-a-need-for-a-do-while-loop
        * Reminder: `for...in` iterates over property *names*; `for...of` iterates over property *values*
    * MDN overview: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration
* User input
    * Video: `window.prompt`, `window.alert`; putting all this all together
        * Incidental: template literals (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
    * MDN references
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert
        * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm
